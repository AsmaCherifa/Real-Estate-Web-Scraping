Real Estate Web Scrapping 

This repository hosts an effictive solution developed with the UiPath Automation Platform.
It simplifies the task of collecting real estate data from redfin.com, a well-known online real estate marketplace in USA. 
The automation robot is tailored to retrieve crucial details about properties in a specified area, such as price, bedroom and bathroom counts, square footage, and address. 
After extraction, the data is intelligently structured, filtered, and arranged based on user-defined preferences, seamlessly merging into an Excel file : List.xlsx.
